# AstrekAI
AstrekAI is a free to use architecture for AI entities in games, primarily Roblox, which includes an implementation for that specific game.  
Currently looking small because I'm adding the 2 older generations of AstrekAI (Luau only) for archival.  
Written in TypeScript. Will be considering other languages later.

## Quick Start
* (Recommended) Use VS Code with these extensions: 
    * roblox-ts
    * Rojo
    * Rojo UI
    * prettier
    * ESLint

* (probally already initialized) Initialize npm in your shell in project dir: ```npm init -y```
* Initialize roblox-ts: ```npm i -D roblox-ts@next```
    * Avoid "npm init roblox-ts" (creates a brand new project)
* Run ```npx rbxtsc -w``` to start watch mode
